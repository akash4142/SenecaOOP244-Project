reflection - hi professor , in this project i have used everything we have learnt so far in this course be it constructors , destructors, memory leaks ,inheritance and many more topics . This was actually a fun for me to complete this project because inorder to practice all the stuff i have learnt i was already working on the project that was about the bank management system so i was already practicing it.
